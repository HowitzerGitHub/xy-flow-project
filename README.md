# Graph-Based Calculator

## Overview

This project is a graph-based calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions using a directed graph of nodes. Each node represents a number or an operator, and the edges define the computation order.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- Parses and evaluates expressions dynamically.
- Handles errors and invalid expressions gracefully.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/graph-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd graph-calculator
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

- Run the calculator script:
  ```sh
  nvm run dev
  ```
- Modify `calculator.js` to test different expressions.
